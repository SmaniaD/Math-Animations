# Math-Animations
Some Python scripts that generate animations to illustrate mathematical ideas.

## wavelet2d
Creates animation of 2d wavelet reconstructions

## wavelet
Creates animations of 1d wavelet reconstructions

## tube_lemma
Creates animations of the proof of the Tube Lemma (in Point Set Topology)

## isotopy
Creates an animation of an isotopy in the unit disc between the identity and a homeomorphism that permutes two points.

## associativity_pi_1
This animation is to illustrate a step in the proof of the associativity of the group operation of the fundamental group.

## squares
This animation illustrated the proof of the following theorem:
Given an open set V ⊂ ℝ² and a compact set K inside it, there is an open set U  that contains K,
its closure is inside V,  and its boundary is a disjoint union of Jordan curves. The details of the proof is explained 
in [StackExchange Mathematics](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/5085691/existence-of-jordan-curves-between-a-compact-and-an-open-set/5085711#5085711)
